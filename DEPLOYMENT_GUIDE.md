## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Repository Setup
- [ ] Code is in GitHub repository
- [ ] `requirements.txt` is in `backend/` directory
- [ ] Flask app listens on `0.0.0.0:5000`
- [ ] CORS is enabled for frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Environment variables are configurable

### ‚úÖ Configuration Files Ready
- [ ] `render.yaml` (for Render deployment)
- [ ] `railway.json` (for Railway deployment)
- [ ] `Dockerfile` (for containerized deployment)
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` (for local testing)

### ‚úÖ Testing
- [ ] App runs locally with `python src/main.py`
- [ ] Generate Fresh Recipes button works
- [ ] Recipe selection and grocery list generation work
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

## Environment Variables

All platforms need these environment variables:

```bash
FLASK_ENV=production
PYTHONPATH=/app/backend  # Adjust path based on platform
PORT=5000
```

Optional for database upgrade:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
```

## Database Options

### SQLite (Default)
- **Pros**: Simple, no setup required, included
- **Cons**: Single file, limited concurrent users
- **Best for**: Personal use, testing

### PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
- **Pros**: Robust, scalable, concurrent users
- **Cons**: Additional cost, setup required
- **Best for**: Production, multiple users

## Custom Domain Setup

### 1. Purchase Domain
- Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.
- Choose something like: `myrecipes.com`

### 2. Configure DNS
Point your domain to your deployment platform:

**Render**: CNAME to `your-app.onrender.com`
**Railway**: CNAME to `your-app.up.railway.app`
**DigitalOcean**: CNAME to `your-app.ondigitalocean.app`

### 3. Add Domain in Platform
- Go to your app settings
- Add custom domain
- SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization
- Static files are served efficiently
- CSS and JS are minified in production
- Images are optimized for web

### Backend Optimization
- Database queries are optimized
- Recipe search results are cached
- API responses are compressed

### Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- Monitor response times and errors
- Set up alerts for downtime

## Security Best Practices

### HTTPS Only
- All platforms provide automatic HTTPS
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Use secure cookies in production

### Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to git
- Use platform environment variable management
- Rotate API keys regularly

### Database Security
- Use strong passwords
- Enable connection encryption
- Regular backups

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check these common issues:
1. requirements.txt in correct directory (backend/)
2. Python version compatibility
3. Missing system dependencies
4. Build timeout (increase if needed)
```

### Runtime Errors
```bash
# Check these common issues:
1. Flask app binding to 0.0.0.0:5000
2. Environment variables set correctly
3. Database permissions and connectivity
4. File system permissions for SQLite
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Optimization steps:
1. Upgrade to paid plan (removes sleep mode)
2. Add database indexes
3. Enable caching
4. Optimize web recipe search queries
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Traffic Growth
- **Low Traffic** (< 100 users): Free/Basic plans sufficient
- **Medium Traffic** (100-1000 users): Professional plans recommended
- **High Traffic** (1000+ users): Enterprise plans with load balancing

### Feature Expansion
- **User Accounts**: Add authentication system
- **Recipe Sharing**: Social features
- **Mobile App**: API-first architecture ready
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
- **SQLite**: Download database file regularly
- **PostgreSQL**: Automated backups on managed platforms
- **Manual Backups**: Export recipe data as JSON

### Code Backups
- GitHub repository serves as code backup
- Tag releases for easy rollback
- Keep deployment configurations in version control

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Usage
- Use Render free tier for personal use
- Monitor build hours usage
- Optimize build times

### Paid Plan Optimization
- Choose right-sized instances
- Monitor resource usage
- Scale down during low usage periods

### Database Costs
- Start with SQLite, upgrade when needed
- Choose appropriate database size
- Monitor storage usage

## Next Steps After Deployment

### 1. Test Everything
- Generate fresh recipes
- Select 4 recipes
- Generate grocery list
- Test on mobile devices

### 2. Share Your App
- Share URL with family/friends
- Get feedback on usability
- Monitor for any issues

### 3. Monitor and Maintain
- Set up uptime monitoring
- Review logs regularly
- Update dependencies periodically

### 4. Enhance Features
- Add user accounts
- Implement recipe ratings
- Add meal planning calendar
- Create shopping list sharing
